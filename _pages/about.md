<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a Research Assistant working with Prof. [Zongli Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n4fG76YAAAAJ&hl=en) at [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/). I got my master's degree from [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/), advised by Prof. [Jie Lu](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=ShCBK4oAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/).

I have a broad interest in optimization problems and network-related issues, and I aim to combine theoretical research with practical applications. I have published several papers and am currently engaged in related research projects. Additionally, I have been invited to serve as a reviewer for academic conferences and journals. 

My long-term research interest includes:

- Optimization
- Distributed learning/Federated learning
- Multiagent systems and decision-making

<!-- <div style="color: red;">
    I'm actively applying for Ph.D. positions in related field in 2025 Spring and Fall. Feel free to email me for academic cooperations or potential interviews.
