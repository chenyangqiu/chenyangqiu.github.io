<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a Research Assistant working with Prof. [Zongli Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n4fG76YAAAAJ&hl=en) and Postdoc [Xiongnan He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5eMfCQoAAAAJ&hl=en) at [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/). I got my master's degree from [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/), advised by Prof. [Jie Lu](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=ShCBK4oAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/).

I have a broad interest in optimization problems and network-related issues, and I aim to combine theoretical research with practical applications. I have published several papers and am currently engaged in related research projects. Additionally, I have been invited to serve as a reviewer for academic conferences and journals. 

My long-term research interest includes:

- Distributed optimization
- Distributed learning/Federated learning
- Stochastic optimization in machine learning

<div style="color: red;">
    I'm actively applying for Ph.D. positions in related field in 2025 Spring and Fall. Feel free to email me for academic cooperations or potential interviews.

  - Stochastic second-order proximal algorithm:

    The first stochastic second-order method for addressing smooth, restricted strongly convex optimization over undirected networks which linearly converges to the suboptimum in expectation.

  - Variance-reduced second-order proximal algorithm:

    An exact distributed second-order stochastic algorithm with variance-reduced methods algorithm which linearly converges to the exact optimum in expectation.

- (2021.09 ‚Äì 2023.06) **Distributed Mixing-Accelerated Algorithm for Nonconvex Optimization**

  - A distributed mixing-accelerated primal-dual proximal algorithm for distributed nonconvex smooth optimization which sublinearly converges to the stationary solution with general nonconvex assumption
    and linearly converges to the optimal solution with P-≈Å condition.

- (2023.09 ‚Äì Now) **Distributed Battery Energy Storage Systems**

  - Trade-off strategy between the usage preference of battery and state-of-charge (SoC) balancing:

    A novel optimization problem formulation that considers the trade-off between the usage preference of battery units and SoC balancing and reformulated it into a distributed optimization problem by estimating a certain global variable.

  - Fast SoC balancing algorithm:

    A novel sufficient condition on the power of each battery for achieving SoC balancing of the battery network; A new power allocating controllers such that accelerated SoC balancing is achieved.
